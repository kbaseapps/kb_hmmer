    <p>This App performs a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) search (hmmsearch) on protein sequences using HMMER models build from an input Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA).</p>

    <p>This App turns a protein multiple sequence alignment (MSA) into a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which is used to search a protein sequence database. The MSA must first be generated using a tool such as MUSCLE to build an MSA from a FeatureSet object. The KBase implementation permits searching through the genes in a Genome object, the genes in the Genome members of a GenomeSet, or the genes in a FeatureSet. The output object of these searches is a FeatureSet containing those genes that pass the thresholds given by the user. The App also provides a table of hits (with those hits that are below the thresholds in gray) and links to download the table of hits and a Stockholm format MSA.</p>

    <p><b>Configuration:</b></p>
    <p><b><i>Query MSA:</i></b> The MSA to use as the query.  It must be generated using an alignment App such as MUSCLE. An HMM will be automatically generated from the MSA by hmmbuild.</p>
    <p><b><i>Targets Object:</i></b> The Targets object may be a FeatureSet of genes, a Genome, or a GenomeSet. An HMMER search database will be automatically generated from the Targets object.</p>
    <p><b><i>Output Object:</i></b> This is the set of genes that hits within the user-defined thresholds.</p>
    <p><b><i>E-value:</i></b> This bounds the e-value for the weakest hit to consider viable. Values below this do not get reported in the table or the HMMER output text downloads.</p>
    <p><b><i>Bitscore:</i></b> This bounds the bit score for the weakest hit to include in the FeatureSet output object. Hits below this threshold are still reported in the table and HMMER text downloads.</p>
    <p><b><i>Max Accepts:</i></b> Limit on the number of hits to report (default is 1000).</p>

    <p><b>Output:</b></p>
    <p><b><i>Output Object:</i></b> Gene hits are captured in a FeatureSet output object. If there are additional user-defined thresholds, those are filtered out and do not appear in the object, even if they are shown in the output table.</p>
    <p><b><i>Output HTML Table:</i></b> The tab-delimited hit table is HTML-formatted and shows the region of the hit sequence (as there is no query sequence) covered by the HMMER alignment. Hits that are above the e-value threshold but below other thresholds and are not included in the FeatureSet output object are shown in gray, with the attributes that were below the threshold in red.</p>
    <p><b><i>Downloadable files:</i></b> HMMER table and Stockholm format MSA are available for download. These are not altered from the direct output from the HMMER run.</p>
